Hi Bj√∂rn, 

Here is the code for my local wordpress installation. I think this may be usefull to see the git process. 
You will also find the database dump here. 

The plugin is running on my simple wordpress site here: http://knittedforyou.com/kanbooks/
I thought it may help you to see it running. 
To admin log in with: Kan-user / JioEsj*h79rNvMZ0tT2qhPB7

Now when I installed on my wordpress site I found out that I needed to change the permalinks to: http://knittedforyou.com/sample-post/ 
in order to make the plugin work. A step that is missing from the plugins README file. 

Please feel free to tell me if there is something more I can do to ease your work.
